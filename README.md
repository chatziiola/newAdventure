Hello everybody! This repo was created on 11/10/2020 by Lamprinos Chatziioannou to simply store and document his progress in cybersec. Nothing exceptional here.

## Bandit Repo
This was completed on 16/10/2020. It includes a "simple" walkthrough to almost all levels one could possibly need to pass the OverTheWire challenges. However, take my advice and do not look at it until after you have spent too much time thinking about how to progress or what to search in order to complete the level. Essentialy, read the file associated with your level only if you have no idea on how to proceed to get a glimpse of the solution (or if you've passed and would like to know if there is another solution).
