Description:
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

Commands you may need to solve this level:
cron, crontab, crontab(5)

Solution:
# The description points us at /etc/cron.d directory (and so in fact does the manual)
# using ls -l /etc/cron.d/ we gain knowledge of the existence of the bandit22 crontab(?)
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
# At that point we see that a file named "cronjob_bandit22.sh" exists
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
# Due to the fact that it doesnt have any permissions we are able to see its function and thus the password (it is hidden there in plain text)
# EDIT (before even completing the file):
# The cron process changes the permissions and then writes the contents of bandit22 to a file in /tmp/. "Cat"ting the file gives us the password
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
