Description:
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

---

Commands you may need to solve this level:
ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd

---

Solution:
# Find what shell user bandit26 uses:
cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
# We now know that a file "/usr/bin/showtext/" exists
# if you look at its attributes it is obvious that we cannot change it in anyway (lack of permissions)
# however "catting" it shows us that when called it "more"s a file
# the file is relatively small and thus more instantly exits
# BYPASS: resize your terminal so that it cant display the whole text
# enter edit mode (thats a real nice tip actually, wasn't aware of it) by pressing v
# view the password file ( you are running as user bandit26) and plainly copy the pswd
