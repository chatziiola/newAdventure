Description:
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Solution
# Check with nmap which ports are open
nmap -sV -p31000-32000 localhost
# Check individually which port or use the following "script"
# (could be written when reviewing)
## !IMPORTANT turns out that -A would have shown only SSL running ports
echo " " | openssl s_client -connect localhost:[port]
# Finally after finding the right port
openssl s_client -connect localhost:[port]
# and provide the asked password. It will give you an RSA key
